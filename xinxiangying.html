		<!--<h4>The purchase process of financial commodity</h4>-->
		<p>As the product shelf of F background, it was necessary to export various financial products to bank users for them to choose, including current and fixed financial products. Considering the versatility and uniqueness of financial products, it was an efficient way to design a common template and make each product flexibly adjust based on this template.</p>
		<p>To design this template and process, we collected all the information that regular financial products must display on the first screen. To facilitate the user to browse the content, the information was arranged from top to bottom according to the browsing order. In addition, as the sales cycle changed, the product information also changed, which was mainly reflected in two parts: one was the product sales progress, and the other was the button status. For example, the text content and status of button were dynamic during the pre-sale, final sale, and sell out stages. The following is a wireframe of the first screen:</p>

		<p>Now, let's say a user was interested in the product and was about to buy it. What should he or she do? In other words, how did users interact with the product? Before paying, we needed to know who the user was and whether he/she could make the purchase directly? We designed a series of logical problems and judgments to determine what interface to present for the user to interact with until the user completed the purchase. What was special about buying financial products was that the policy stipulated that risk and age assessment were necessary prerequisite. Therefore, we need to add these evaluation processes to the whole purchase process. After the user passes the evaluation process, they could make normal purchase. In the process of purchase amount, some details still need to be considered, such as insufficient balance and the use of cash deduction coupons. After accurately entering the transaction password, the whole purchase process is over. The following is the wireflow of this part:</p>

		<p>When a user had purchased a product, there was a place to look for details of the transaction, and that place was the position page. There were three entries to reach this position page, in this page the user was not just to view, if the product was still in the sales period, the user could cancel the order or additional purchase. The money transaction status should also be clear to show to the customer, so that users could understand the money in time dynamic also a sense of security. Here is the flow about position page:</p>
