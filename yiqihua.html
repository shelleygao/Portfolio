		<h1>F</h1>
		<!-- <h4>The process of purchasing non-financial products</h4> -->
		<p>F was a strategic program. In F program, there were all the functions and products needed to build a banking APP, from which our small and medium-sized bank clients could choose and assemble an APP that met their own needs.</p>
		<p>At that time, the backstage product shelves were all financial products, which were relatively single. Clients wanted to enrich the product shelves by providing cost-effective non-financial products, so as to meet the diversified consumption scenarios of users. After discussion among stakeholders, it was decided to increase the sales of some popular commodities in the application by integrating peripheral resources.</p>
		<p>But compared to the purchase of financial product, the biggest difference were that the various options for choosing, the logistics information for adding and editing and installment payment method needed be considered when users bought the entity goods. Therefore, we needed to increase these consideration into transaction process and a new credit payment with installment function into original payment system. We hoped this credit payment own it's independent name and brand for multi-channel extension in future, it could give users perceived advantages and credibility. After the team discussion, we named it "Yiqihua", so I decided to use the chinese character "èŠ±" combining with shopping bag as elements to design a logo, which would convey the meaning of these keywords like convenience, freedom, high credit, low rate to make users have a pleasure feeling when they shop on our app using Yiqihua Credit Pay. The following is my design about Yiqihua logo:</p>

		<p>In addition, we designed the purchase process including process of Yiqihua account opening and introduced interest-free installment promotion information to attract a large number of users to open Yiqihua accounts. The following is the mock-up of the whole process of the user buying non-financial goods with Yiqihua for payment:</p>

		<p>Here is the visual elements for developers to refer to:</p>

		<p>Finally, I programmed interactive prototypes with Html, CSS and Javascript. <a href="https://shelleygao.github.io/shelleygao.github.io-payment/" class="textLink">Open the prototype  &#8594</a></p>
