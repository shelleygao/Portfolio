		<!-- <h4>The process of purchasing non-financial products</h4> -->
		<p>F was a strategic program. In the F program, there were all the functions and products needed to build a banking APP, from which our small and medium-sized bank clients could choose and assemble an APP that met their own needs.</p>
		<p>At that time, the backstage product shelves were all financial products, which were relatively single. Clients wanted to enrich the product shelves by providing cost-effective non-financial products, to meet the diversified consumption scenarios of users. After discussion among stakeholders, it was decided to increase the sales of some popular commodities in the application by integrating peripheral resources.</p>
		<p>But compared to the purchase of the financial product, the biggest difference was that the various options for choosing, the logistics information for adding and editing and the installment payment method needed to be considered when users bought the entity goods. Therefore, we needed to increase these considerations into the transaction process and a new credit payment with installment function into the original payment system. We hoped this credit payment own its independent name and brand for multi-channel extension in the future, it could give users perceived advantages and credibility. After the team discussion, we named it "Yiqihua", so I decided to use the Chinese character "èŠ±" combining with shopping bag as elements to design a logo, which would convey the meaning of these keywords like convenience, freedom, high credit, low rate to make users have a pleasant feeling when they shop on our app using Yiqihua Credit Pay. The following is my design about Yiqihua logo:</p>
		<div class="logo"><img src="./img/yiqihua-w logo.svg" alt="yiqihua logo" width="100%"></div>
		<p>Besides, we designed the purchase process including the process of Yiqihua account opening and introduced interest-free installment promotion information to attract a large number of users to open Yiqihua accounts. The following is the mock-up of the whole process of the user buying non-financial goods with Yiqihua for payment:</p>

		<p>Here are the visual elements for developers to refer to:</p>

		<p>Since I just learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm going to try it out on this project, and here's the link <a href="https://shelleygao.github.io/yiqihua/" class="textLink">view the prototype  &#8594</a>, which requires toggling mobile devices to browse in Chrome.</p>
