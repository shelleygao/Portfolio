		<h1>Lottery</h1>
		<h4>version2.0</h4>
		<p>Ping An lottery project was the first GUI design revision project that I completed independently.</p>
		<p>As the first version of lottery had simple functions and single products, the leader of lottery division hoped to increase the number of application downloads and activity on the mobile terminal by enriching products and functions, optimizing the interface and interaction, and promoting through multiple channels.</p>
		<p>At that time, there was no good design solution for cross-platform and cross-device. I could only design interfaces for android, iOS and iPadOS to achieve the best adaptive effect. In addition, designed various banners and activity pages to match the marketing promotion.</p>
		<p>As expected，various data indicators improved significantly after the revision. Below is a powerpoint presentation of my phased achievement report at that time.</p>
