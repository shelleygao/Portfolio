		<h4>Web Redesign</h4>
		<p>My client said: <br>
		“ We want to remake our entire website (www.lippetaylor.com) from scratch. Our current site has too much copy, too many pages, and overall too much content. We want a more streamlined (minimalist) website and UX experience. ”</p>
		<p>What I found: <br>
			After browsing the website, I found: <br>
			● The original site is colorful, but no obvious brand attributes. <br>
			● The work section is not highlighted enough, which is important to demonstrate the strength of the organization and to build trust. <br>
			● The information structure of the home page is not particularly clear, so that customers can not understand the core information in a short time. <br>
		    ● Legibility is not taken into account in the presentation of content.</p>
		<p>What I have done: <br>
			Therefore, in view of the above points and the customer's wish, I made the following improvements:<br>
			● Primary and secondary color definitions: enhance brand recognition and personality.<br>
			● Navigation disclosure: makes navigation more direct.<br>
			● One page of vertical scrolling: browse all sections on one page.<br>
			● Color and size contrast: highlights visual hierarchy.<br>
			● The use of the grid layout: diversified layout according to the primary and secondary content, Improve legibility.<br>
			The interaction effects includes: <br>
			● Tab toggle effect<br>
		    ● Parallax effect<br>
	        ● Hover reflection</p>
