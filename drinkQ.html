		<h1>DinkQ</h1>
		<h4>Conceptual Project - Ongoing</h4>
		<p>This is a conceptual web design. Through the design practice, I would like to know more about the following aspects: <br>
			1. Product selection and purchase process. <br>
		    2. Adaptation of screens of different sizes. <br>
	        3. Scalability of the design scheme.</p>
	    <p>Product positioning: provide online channels for customers to buy wine, spirits and beer. <br>
           Client: adults over 21 years old.</p>
           <p>What did I do: <br>
           	1. I researched other websites and learned about the policies of alcohol trading, such as the dealer needs the specific license for selling each kinds of alcohol, the consumer of alcohol have a specific age limit, and the trading restrictions on cross states, etc. 	<br>	
           	2. When drawing the wireframe, I thought about how users search products, how to select the products they wanted among various products, what they most need to know in the product details section, and what information users need to provide when submitting orders.
           </p>
           
            <div class="wireframe"><img src="./img/DrinkQsketch.png" alt="Wireframe" width="100%"></div>
            <p>Prototype:</p>
<div class="video gray">
	<video width="272" height="480" controls="controls"  muted="muted" loop="loop" autoplay="autoplay">
  <source src="./video/DrinkQ.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
</div>
<p>Conclusion: <br>
           	1. Extract key information of the product and show it to the user, understand the limitations of the product, and put the user's intuition in the first place. <br>
           	2. In terms of the adaptation of different sizes, the mobile-first design principle is adopted to ensure the smooth operation of key functions on small screens, and the desktop and mobile operation habits are integrated into the design. <br>
            3. Scalability of product information and layout.</p>
