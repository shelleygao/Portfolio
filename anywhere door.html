		<h1>AnyDoor</h1>
		<h4>version1.0</h4>
		<p>AnyDoor was a group strategic project. The concept came from "a door to go anywhere". Its original purpose was to realize mutual jump and conversion between apps of Ping An. I was involved from the beginning and discussed directly with my leadership and the CEO.</p>
		<p>At that time, the market situation was that a large number of users began moving to the mobile terminal, and more and more apps were developed by the group. We expected users to experience diversified group products. Many users had installed more than two apps of Ping An group.</p>
        <p>After the discussion, the initial version was decided to use an icon as an entry similar to an entry in the group's app store, and this icon was placed on the home page of the subsidiaries. When the user clicked on it, a full-screen page will be unfolded. Based on these ideas, I started to design the scheme.</p>
        <p>Of course, I had some thoughts before designing:<br>
        1. Since the app development and operation of the subsidiaries were independent, and the visual style of subsidiaries was out of control, the AnyDoor icon should match and not disturb the host app.<br>
        2. The icon should be consistent across each app.<br>
        3. The icon should reflect the concept of apps collection and match the brand gene of Ping An.<br></p>
        <p>Then, I designed a lot of schemes. Finally, everyone agreed on the one which I extracted letter A from Ping An logo as the shape of the icon and filled it with a variety of colors, implying diversity and integration.</p>        
		<div class="box pingan">
		    <img src="./img/logo_pingan.svg" alt="logo pingan" width="30%">
		</div>
		<div class="box alt">
			<img src="./img/logo_anywhere1.png" alt="alternative solution" width="50%">
		</div>
		<div class="box anywhere">
			<img src="./img/logo_anywhere.svg" alt="anywhere door" width="25%">
		</div>		
		<div class="box apps">
			<img src="./img/anywhere apps.png" alt="alternative solution" width="90%">
		</div>
		<p>When designing the unfolded page of AnyDoor, I also needed to consider: <br>
			1. The layout consisted of navigation, banner, download area, and bottom operation buttons.<br>
			2. The states of downloaded and undownloaded should be distinguished.<br>
			3. The content included insurance, banking, financial management, points, and social contact. The tiles background should be different between financial and non-financial types and could be replaced.<br>
		    4. Description of design rules.</p>
		<p>The following is the unfolded page and tile scheme of AnyDoor:</p>
		<div class="box anywhere_hp">
			<img src="./img/anywhere homepage.png" alt="alternative solution" width="50%">
		</div>
		<div class="box anywhere_rules">
			<img src="./img/anywhere_tiles.png" alt="alternative solution" width="50%">
		</div>
		<p>Despite many obstacles to placing AnyDoor on the homepage of the subsidiaries' app, the first version was successfully launched. After that, with the continuous promotion of the company's management, AnyDoor was constantly iterating. Now, it is no longer a small icon entrance, but a richer content display that directly occupies 1/6 of the screen of the host's app. It not only covers apps' downloads but also integrates the comprehensive account management and marketing of the group, better realizing the transformation within the group and winning more customers.</p>
